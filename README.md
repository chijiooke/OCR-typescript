# OCR-typescript
An Optical character recognition(OCR) system built with typescript, nodejs, tesseract js and react.js

Recognition is heavily dependent on Image Quality and font types.

Future Plans:
<br>ðŸš€ Add a "text to speech" component
<br>ðŸš€ Improve the recognition to support handwritting fonts.
